I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way — and I’m glad you told me.

I can’t keep you safe in an emergency or contact anyone for you. If you feel like you might hurt yourself, or you’re in immediate danger, please get urgent help right now:
- Call your local emergency number or go to the nearest emergency room.
- If you’re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline).
- If you’re outside the U.S., use your local crisis line or emergency number.

If you can, tell a trusted person nearby what’s going on and stay with someone until you’re safer.

Are you safe right now, or feeling at risk of harming yourself?
